```

## Notify for services

After FreePBX configurations have been applied, some containers should be restarted or reloaded.
The `watcher.path` units looks for files named `<action>_<service>` inside the `notify` directory.

If a container wants to signal a restart, it must mount the file using the `volume` option. Eg:
```
--volume=./notify:/notify
```

Then, create a file named `<action>_<service>`, like `reload_nethcti-server`.
The file must be created inside the container. Example:
```
touch /notify/restart_nethcti-server
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall the instance:

    remove-module --no-preserve nethvoice1

## Testing

Test the module using the `test-module.sh` script:


    ./test-module.sh <NODE_ADDR> ghcr.io/nethserver/nethvoice:latest

The tests are made using [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/)
